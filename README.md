# Paris-Resort

Website created for a parisian hostel. The project uses React router for routing, React context API for state management, Contentful headless CMS for data management, and Netlify to host the application. 

If you want to see a demo of this application, check this out:

Thanks to Contentful CMS, the user can edit, remove or add the new rooms and decide which one should be featured on the main page.
